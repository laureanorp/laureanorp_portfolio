### Resume and Portfolio website (kinda old)

Code for my portfolio website,  https://laureanorp.github.io/laureanorp_portfolio. I started this project in 2015, when I first wanted to learn HTML and CSS. Since then, I have redesigned it many times, slowly adding stuff related to graphic design and my education. I consider it **outdated**, as now I'm a Python Developer and decided to create a simpler version of it on laureanoruiz.com.
