### Resume and Portfolio website (kinda old)

Code for my portfolio website, https://laureanoruiz.com. I started this project in 2015, when I first wanted to learn HTML and CSS. Since then, I have redesigned it many times, slowly adding stuff related to graphic design and my education. I consider it **outdated**, as now I'm a Python Developer.
